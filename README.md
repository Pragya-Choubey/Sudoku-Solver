A simple sudoku solver in C++.
You can download this code and try my algorithm with other Sudoku boards.

How the Program Works?


The program starts by creating a SudokuSolver object, which prompts the user to input the Sudoku puzzle either manually or from a file.
The program then attempts to solve the puzzle using a recursive backtracking algorithm.
The grid is displayed before and after solving, and the number of recursive calls made during the solving process is printed.
